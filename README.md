**Support Libraries** -- [TOML11](https://github.com/ToruNiina/toml11) by Dr. Toru Niina

---

To build for yourself, install the support library/libraries as instructed on their pages, nothing else should be required; after installing, enter `src/` and `make run`, which will compile and run the executable.

Please note this program is currently Linux-only. I plan to make a Windows and potentially Mac (though I don't have a way to test on Mac currently) port later down the road.
