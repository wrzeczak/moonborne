# A Space Dwarf Mining Game

A game in which you, and your fellow moon-dwarves, will mine, expand, and politic, all with the goal of re-uniting the Moon and repopulating the Earth.

To build for yourself, install those two libraries as instructed on their pages, nothing else should be required; after installing, enter `src/` and `make run`, which will compile and run the executable.

Please note this program is currently Linux-only. I plan to make a Windows and potentially Mac (though I don't have a way to test on Mac currently) port later down the road.
